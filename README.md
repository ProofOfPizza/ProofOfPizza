Forever learning new things! Started my career as a musician (new music coming out soon!), I added professional work as a tester to it, 
then went on to test automation and recently moved on to developer role. 
Worked in the Netherlands for a variety of organisations in finance, retail and government. 

Lately focussed on expanding knowledge and experience in Typescript, Angular, Nestjs, MongoDB, Sql, Java, Springboot, AWS, Terraform, Jenkins (and other CICD tools).
Preferred tools are: Nixos, Vim.
Most recent fun things on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ProofOfPizza)!

Stuff I find important and fun: Learning new things, math, open source, internet freedom and privacy, collaboration.
